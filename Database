The definition of our problem lies in manual system and a fully automated system.

Manual system: It is very inconvenient to always go to the salon and wait in the queue during the busy hours.Moreover, one doesn’t even know if the specific salon provides the services ,the customer requires.

Technical system: With the advent of latest technology if we do not update our system thenOur business results in losses gradually with time. We have developed a web application to book appointment online. This will not only saver the efforts of the customer  but also show him the services beforehand. He will also get to know more information about the salons nearby him. This way our web application will help the customer make an informed decision.

DATABASE NORMALIZATION

First Normal Form:-

The relation is in 1NF if it has no repeating groups. All  tables has no repeating groups so they are in 1NF.


Tables:-


1] Customer:-



cust_email

   (PK)	
city	
fname
	
lname
	
address
	
cust_password	
gender




2] appointment:-



appointment_id
       (PK)	
	
status	
completed
	
total_cost
	
cust_email
    (FK)	
sal_email
    (FK)	
appt_date	
appt_time


Second Normal Form

A relation is said to be in second normal form if it is already in first normal form and it has no partial dependency
Foreign Key references the primary key of another Table.This helps in referential integrity i.e. only those values can be present in the referenced table which are already present in the parent table.

In appointment table, attributes sal_email and cust_email are foreign keys and they reference sal_email of salon table and cust_email of customer table ,respectively.


1] Customer:-



cust_email

   (PK)	
city	
fname
	
lname
	
address
	
cust_password	
gender









2] appointment:-


appointment_id
       (PK)	
	
status	
completed
	
total_cost
	
cust_email
    (FK)	
sal_email
    (FK)	
appt_date	
appt_time





3]Salon:-



sal_email
   (PK)	
sal_name	
sal_city	
sal_password	
sal_contact	
sal_address	
noOfSeats	
approved	
rating
	
noOfRatings





Third Normal Form

A relation is said to be in third normal form if it is already in 1st and 2nd NF and has no transitive dependency.

A transitive functional dependency is when changing a non-key column, might cause any of the other non-key columns to change

3NF is used to reduce the data duplication. It is also used to achieve the data integrity.

If there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes, then the relation must be in third normal form.
