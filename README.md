# Salon-Management-System

In this project we have created a web application which is easy to access and user friendly. For this application we used MySQL as backend to store the data which is used in the application and for the user interface we had used the JSP, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and HTML 5. The application can be used by Database Administrator, Customer and Authorized Salon Owner. The customer is able to book an appointment online according to his convenience from anywhere by selecting the salon and the services. The Shop owner is able to register the salon, add and remove
the services from the site. The Administrator is the only person who has rights to approve the salon on the site, otherwise the salon will not be registered.
