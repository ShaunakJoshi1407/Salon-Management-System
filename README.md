# Salon-Management-System

In this project we have created a web application which is easy to access and user friendly. For this application we used MySQL as backend to store the data which is used in the application and for the user interface we had used the JSP, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and HTML 5. The application can be used by Database Administrator, Customer and Authorized Salon Owner. The customer is able to book an appointment online according to his convenience from anywhere by selecting the salon and the services. The Shop owner is able to register the salon, add and remove
the services from the site. The Administrator is the only person who has rights to approve the salon on the site, otherwise the salon will not be registered.


With the advent of technology , it has become easier for us to control many things with just a single touch of our hands. It is very inconvenient to always go to the salon and wait in the queue during the busy hours .Moreover, one doesnâ€™t even know if the specific salon provides the services ,the customer requires. Thus we have developed a web application to book appointment online. This will not only saver the efforts of the customer  but also show him the services beforehand. This way our web application will help the customer make an informed decision.
